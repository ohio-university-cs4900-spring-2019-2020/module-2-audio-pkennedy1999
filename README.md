Tried for multiple hours but could not get Linux VM on my Mac to build the module. Just did project on Linux machines
in the lab hoping the sound would just work if you tested it because computers in lab do not have speakers and headphone
jacks do not work either. However, I did get the code to compile with the IrrKlang libraries so hopefully you hear sound
when you test it because I had no way of knowing if sound was being played or not.
